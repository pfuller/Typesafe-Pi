Copy of the Typesafe getting started tutorial for Typesafe 1.1 which calculates Pi using Leibniz formula for Pi and the “embarrassingly parallel” algorithm see:
http://typesafe.com/resources/getting-started/tutorials/getting-started-first-scala.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi

You will need SBT 0.7.7 to run this see https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup

run the following in the project after cloning it:
